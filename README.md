# Whack-a-mole
This is a whack-a-mole game that I coded with HTML, CSS, and JS.

Progress Log:

3/22/2022: Today I was able to create the core elements of the game. These elements include alternating "mole" locations. If the player clicks the correct mole location, they gain a point. If the player clicks the incorrect mole location, they lose a point.
